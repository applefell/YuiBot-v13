# YuiBot-v13
 YuiBot but for discordjs v13 because I rewrote most of it and did not feel like trying to mess around with my original code because of how messy it is.
 
 # WIP
 Just started working on this not too long ago. Should be pretty much the same thing as my other repository, YuiBot-Rebuild, but eventually will take over as the main repository for work on my bot.
 
 # [Goals](https://github.com/applefell/YuiBot-v13/projects/1)
 - [ ] Add back all of the original commands with some tweaks to make them work as slash commands
 - [ ] Add the ability to still use a prefix instead of just slash commands
 - [ ] Add back the economy and levelling system
 - [ ] Improved help command
 - [ ] Improved image command, maybe using buttons
 - [ ] Moderation features like tempbans
 - [ ] Music commands maybe
 - [ ] Website integration
 - [ ] Sharding support
